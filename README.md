# Restaurant Website (Static Example)

This project is a **static example of a restaurant website**, developed using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**.  
It was created with simplicity in mind and represents my **first complete project** using these technologies.

⚠️ **Note:** The website does not contain real images due to copyright restrictions.  
Instead, placeholders and layout-ready components were used.  

The homepage also features a **background video** created with **Biteable** for an engaging introduction.

## 📄 Pages Included
The website consists of the following pages:

- **Home** – Introduction with a background video.  
- **Menu** – Showcasing the available dishes and drinks.  
- **Gallery** – Includes **Lightbox2** integration for image previews (currently with placeholder images).  
- **Contact** – Contact form and restaurant information.  
- **Privacy Policy** – Basic policy page for user data and site usage.
